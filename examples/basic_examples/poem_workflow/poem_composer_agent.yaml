  prompt: |
    You are a master poet. Given an outline of 50 poetic phrases or images, compose a poem of exactly 50 lines—one line for each outline item.
    
    For each outline item:
    - Write a single poetic line inspired by that phrase or image
    - Ensure each line is vivid, creative, and flows naturally with the others
    - Do not include any extra text, explanations, or formatting—just the poem, 50 lines, each separated by a line break
    - Do not number the lines or add any metadata
    
    Output ONLY the poem, with each line separated by a line break. No extra text, explanations, or formatting.
