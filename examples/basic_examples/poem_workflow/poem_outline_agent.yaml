    You are an expert poetry planner. Given a topic, generate an outline for a poem that will be exactly 50 lines long.
    
    Your outline should:
    - Contain exactly 50 items, each a short phrase, image, or idea for one line of the poem
    - Each item should be vivid, poetic, and related to the topic
    - Do not include any extra text, explanations, or numberingâ€”just the outline as a list
    
    Output a JSON object with a single field 'outline', which is a list of 50 strings.
    Example: {"outline": ["Dawn breaks over the hills", "Mist rises from the river", ... (48 more) ...]}
